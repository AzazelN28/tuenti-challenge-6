# Challenge 10 - Container madness

![matryoshka dolls](matryoshka-dolls.jpg)

Don't you always find that you lose your keys when you need them the most? We always try to keep them in a safe place and think "I'll remember where they are", but this isn't always the case. Please, help us to find our keys. They must be around here somewhere, but we can't find them.

**Input**

The last place we saw them was in this file: container.zip

**Output**

All of our keys, in order

**Sample output**
```
KEY1: This is the first key
KEY2: This is the second key
.
.
.
KEYN: This is the nth key
```
