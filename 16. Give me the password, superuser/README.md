# Challenge 16 - Give me the password, superuser

We have found a service that has this level's output. The only problem is that it keeps asking for a password, which we don't have. We have been able to get access to the program in the service; we hope it helps. The service is running at:

**52.49.91.111:9999**
**Input**

This problem has no input

**Output**

The key

NOTE: In this level, the output for the submit phase is the same as the output for the test phase.
